# Sudoku
Sudoku with a solver

The solver is yet to be implemented but will hopefully use backtracking and a custom coded algorithm that would use real world sudoku strateigies.

Controls:

W - Toggles between write and note mode.

E - Prompts edit mode, used for the user inputting a custom sudoku board.

R - Resets the board to blank

N - Sets the board to a random easy sudoku

S - (not yet implemented) Solves the board with an animation

(open console for some useful notes about the current state / actions)
